    "\n",
    "* You can **pick 3–4 AI features** (not everything) and justify the trade-offs in their UX Summary slide.\n",
    "* **Prioritise 3-4 AI features**; argue in the UX-summary slide why others were deferred.\n",
    "* Please label every mock-up with **“AI touchpoint” call-outs** to satisfy the rubric on explicating AI.\n",
    "* Also try to demo **one micro-interaction** per project (e.g., swap suggestion animation, OCR field highlight, scan progress ring). These can be quick Figma Smart-Animate tricks.\n",
    "* You are also encouraged to do **role-playing walkthroughs**: one student is the user, one the narrator.\n",
    "* Please do not forget to label every mock-up with the AI touchpoint (“Powered by CV model”, “LLM rationale pop-over”) – this anchors grading to the AI-UX link mandated in the workshop brief.&#x20;\n"

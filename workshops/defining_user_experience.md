## **Workshop**  **Defining user experience (Front End)**

---

### **🎯 Purpose of the exercise**

As part of your project, you have been asked to define and design the **user experience** of your front-end interface.  
 You now need to **present this thinking**, the stages followed, and all the elements that accompany your design.

The aim is to **justify your UX/UI** choices through a clear process: from understanding the user need right through to the final mock-ups.

###

## **🧱 What you need to present**

---

### **🧠 1\. User issues and target audience**

You need to explain:

* What **user problem** your interface is trying to solve.  
* Who is **your main user** (persona): their profile, goals, needs.  
* In what context does this user interact with your application?

💡 You may have illustrated this using one or two **personas**.

---

### **🔍 2\. The user research phase**

You need to describe how you gathered information about your users:

* Field studies (mini-interviews, questionnaires, user feedback, etc.)  
* Benchmark of similar interfaces  
* Summary of the **user insights** you have retained

📝 Summarise the key elements of this research: expectations, obstacles, habits.

###

### **👣 3\. The user path**

You should have defined a clear **user path**, structuring the different stages of using your application.

Examples:

* Connection → action choice → exploration → results  
* Upload → process → view

📍 You've diagrammed this journey as a **diagram**, **mind map**, or **storyboard**.

### 

---

### **🧩 4\. The application's key screens**

You need to present a **list of screens** required in your front-end.  
 For each screen, you have identified:

* Its role in the customer journey  
* The main elements (CTA, navigation, display)

💡 This could have been structured as a **list, table or mindmap**.

---

### **🎨 5\. Interface mock-ups**

You must provide **at least 3 mock-ups** representing key screens in your interface.

The mock-ups must show:

* The organisation of the elements  
* Graphic or functional intention  
* Visual hierarchy (navigation, titles, actions)

📐 Possible tools: Figma, Canva, Miro, Adobe XD, or even scanned sketches.

---

### **🚀 6\. (Optional) A working prototype**

If you've thought things through further, you can present :

* An **interactive prototype** with simulated navigation.  
* A **front demo** partially coded.

🎁 This bonus is highly valued.

### 

---

### **📄 7\. A UX summary sheet**

You need to prepare a **summary sheet** or **slide** that summarises:

* The user problem  
* User profile  
* Overall itinerary  
* The main models  
* Justified design choices

Free format: PDF document, slide, section in the deliverable.

---

## **✅ Expected deliverables**

* The **personas** and user research.  
* The schematised **user journey.**  
* The **defined screens**  
* The **mock-ups (minimum 3\)**  
* A **UX summary sheet**  
* (Optional) An **interactive prototype**

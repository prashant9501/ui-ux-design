**Dojo: User Research**

**Introduction**

You now have the beginnings of a product: a clear idea of the problem you want to solve, and the first features you want to deliver.

At this stage, it's easy to fall into a classic trap: plunging headlong into development and losing sight of your product's main objective \- to solve a real problem for real users.

So it's essential to stay constantly connected to your target users. And there's nothing better than conducting interviews\!

To conduct effective interviews, you need to:  
‚óè Know who to talk to (who your target customer is),  
‚óè Know what to ask them,  
‚óè How to contact them.

In this dojo, you'll answer these three key questions.

**1\. Specifically define your target customers**   
Use the concepts covered in the first few weeks of training (persona, segmentation, early adopters, etc.) to clearly identify who your solution is aimed at.

**2\. Build an interview template/outline**  
The aim: to validate your understanding of your users' problem, and check that your solution  
really meets their needs. Ask open-ended questions, avoid confirmation bias  
and listen actively.

**3\. Define your contact strategies**  
How are you going to find your users? Social networks, online communities, street interviews, calls for witnesses... Be creative and pragmatic\!

**üéÅ Bonus: Think about marketing now**

A good product doesn't sell itself. Think ahead about your communication:  
‚óè Which messages will grab attention?  
‚óè Which channels to use to reach your target customers?  
‚óè What concrete actions can be taken to arouse interest and generate your first users?
